# Django Task Management System API

## Overview

This project is a RESTful API for a Task Management System built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It allows users to perform CRUD operations on tasks with properties such as title, description, status, priority, and due date. The project includes advanced features like custom filters and efficient logging.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Filtering:** Filter tasks based on status, priority, and due date.
- **Logging:** Detailed logging setup for development and production environments.
- **HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE:**  highly costomizable class based views, serializers, 
- **Advance Modular and Reusable Code:** by use of Mixins, Method Overriding, Custom TestCases, and many more
- **Caching:** i have used caching for reduce database load in production we can use distributed cache like redis or memcach with connection pooling
- **Faker:**  Generate fake data for testing purpose. using "python create_fake_data.py" or "python manage.py create_fake_data" 
- **Pagination:** for large response data, i implemeneted pagination for quick response
- **Documentation:** API documentation using DRF-YASG.


### Prerequisites

Run the Development Server:
Start the development server to run the API:

python manage.py runserver

optional:
  in other ternimal use can use this to Generate fake data for testing purpose. 
    "python create_fake_data.py" or "python manage.py create_fake_data"
